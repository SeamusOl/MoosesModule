# MoosesModule

To use the module:
* download the MoosesModule folder and drag it into the content folder of your project within file explorer.
* Once the folder has been dragged in, add "using { MoosesModule.mooses_module }" to the top of any file you wish to use the module in.
* To use a submodule, such as "utils", add "using { utils }" under the "using { MoosesModule.mooses_module }" line.
* After adding the using statement it might show an error at first, build Verse code and the error should go away.
