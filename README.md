# MoosesModule

To use the module download the MoosesModule folder and drag it into the content folder of your project within file explorer.
Once the folder has been dragged in, add "using { MoosesModule.mooses_module }" to the top of any file you wish to use the module in.
After adding the using statement it might show an error at first, build Verse code and the error should go away.
